# Introduction

Bindeo provides a RESTful API to easily integrate our services in your systems. Using this documentation you will be able to access al described resources from our application.

We have language bindings in Shell, Php, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

## Languages

Bindeo works with different languages and country locales. Some resources need to be provided with a specific locale to work. Current supported locales are `en_US`, `es_ES`.
